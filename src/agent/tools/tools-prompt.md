# Tools operations

Tool name: FinishCoding
Tool description: Finish the current coding session and return to normal mode. Use this tool when you have completed all the required coding tasks and want to provide a summary of what was accomplished during the coding session.

Usage:
- Call this tool only when you have finished all coding tasks
- Provide a comprehensive summary of what was accomplished
- This will gracefully exit the coding mode and return control to the main agent
- The summary will be returned as the result of the newAction command

Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'A comprehensive summary of what was accomplished during this coding session, including files created/modified, features implemented, and any important notes.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}

Tool name: LS
Tool description: Lists files and directories in a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter. You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep tools, if you know which directories to search.
Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The absolute path to the directory to list (must be absolute, not relative)'}, 'ignore': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of glob patterns to ignore'}}, 'required': ['path'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}

Tool name: Read
Tool description: Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.
- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.
- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful. 
- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths like /var/folders/123/abc/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_ZfB1tD/Screenshot.png
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The absolute path to the file to read'}, 'offset': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'The line number to start reading from. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once'}, 'limit': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'The number of lines to read. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.'}}, 'required': ['file_path'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}

---


Tool name: Edit
Tool description: Performs exact string replacements in files. 

Usage:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. 
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`. 
- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.
Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The absolute path to the file to modify'}, 'old_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The text to replace'}, 'new_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The text to replace it with (must be different from old_string)'}, 'replace_all': {'type': 'boolean', 'default': False, 'description': 'Replace all occurences of old_string (default false)'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'old_string', 'new_string'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}

---


Tool name: MultiEdit
Tool description: This is a tool for making multiple edits to a single file in one operation. It is built on top of the Edit tool and allows you to perform multiple find-and-replace operations efficiently. Prefer this tool over the Edit tool when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.

Before using this tool:

1. Use the Read tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct

To make multiple file edits, provide the following:
1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:
   - old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
   - new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string
   - replace_all: Replace all occurences of old_string. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

IMPORTANT:
- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided
- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit
- All edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails, none will be applied
- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file
- For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEdit instead

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single Edit tool
2. The edits are atomic - either all succeed or none are applied
3. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations

WARNING:
- The tool will fail if edits.old_string doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)
- The tool will fail if edits.old_string and edits.new_string are the same
- Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure that earlier edits don't affect the text that later edits are trying to find

When making edits:
- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code
- Do not leave the code in a broken state
- Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

If you want to create a new file, use:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- First edit: empty old_string and the new file's contents as new_string
- Subsequent edits: normal edit operations on the created content
Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The absolute path to the file to modify'}, 'edits': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'old_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The text to replace'}, 'new_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The text to replace it with'}, 'replace_all': {'type': 'boolean', 'default': False, 'description': 'Replace all occurences of old_string (default false).'}}, 'required': ['old_string', 'new_string'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'minItems': 1, 'description': 'Array of edit operations to perform sequentially on the file'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'edits'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}

---


Tool name: Write
Tool description: Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.
Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The absolute path to the file to write (must be absolute, not relative)'}, 'content': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The content to write to the file'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}

Tool name: TodoWrite
Tool description: Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

## Examples of When to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!
Assistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.
*Creates todo list with the following items:*
1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page
2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)
3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme
4. Update existing components to support theme switching
5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur
*Begins working on the first task*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes
2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward
3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding "Ensure tests and build succeed" as the final task
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project
Assistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.
*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*
Assistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.
*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task
2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps
3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically
4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency
</reasoning>
</example>


<example>
User: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.
Assistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.
*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*
Assistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list
2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks
3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>
Assistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*
Assistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.
*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*
Let's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues
2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities
3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps
4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components
5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed
</reasoning>
</example>

## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?
Assistant: In Python, you can print "Hello World" with this simple code:

python
print("Hello World")

This will output the text "Hello World" to the console when executed.</assistant>

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: What does the git status command do?
Assistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?
Assistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.
* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.
Assistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.

*Executes: npm install*

The command completed successfully. Here's the output:
[Output of npm install command]

All dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.
</reasoning>
</example>

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
   - Never mark a task as completed if:
     - Tests are failing
     - Implementation is partial
     - You encountered unresolved errors
     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

4. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.

Tool name: Glob
Tool description: - Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.
Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'pattern': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The glob pattern to match files against'}, 'path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The directory to search in. If not specified, the current working directory will be used. IMPORTANT: Omit this field to use the default directory. DO NOT enter "undefined" or "null" - simply omit it for the default behavior. Must be a valid directory path if provided.'}}, 'required': ['pattern'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}

---


Tool name: Grep
Tool description: A powerful search tool built on ripgrep

  Usage:
  - ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a Bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.
  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+")
  - Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., "*.js", "**/*.tsx") or type parameter (e.g., "js", "py", "rust")
  - Output modes: "content" shows matching lines, "files_with_matches" shows only file paths (default), "count" shows match counts
  - Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
  - Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\{\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)
  - Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \{[\s\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`

Input schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'pattern': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The regular expression pattern to search for in file contents'}, 'path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'File or directory to search in (rg PATH). Defaults to current working directory.'}, 'glob': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Glob pattern to filter files (e.g. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}") - maps to rg --glob'}, 'output_mode': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['content', 'files_with_matches', 'count'], 'description': 'Output mode: "content" shows matching lines (supports -A/-B/-C context, -n line numbers, head_limit), "files_with_matches" shows file paths (supports head_limit), "count" shows match counts (supports head_limit). Defaults to "files_with_matches".'}, '-B': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Number of lines to show before each match (rg -B). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.'}, '-A': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Number of lines to show after each match (rg -A).
